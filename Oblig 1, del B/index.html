        <h2>Sander Sletvold, 385508</h2>
        <p>I went to high school at Skedsmo Videregående Skole.
            <br>
            Opposed to it's name, the school is acually located in Lillestrøm.
            <br>
            A few weeks before I started my first year, parts of the school were destroyed in a fire.
            <br>
            I would say the school could use some renovation, but me and many of the approximately 1200 students can look back at great years.
