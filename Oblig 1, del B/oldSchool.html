        <h1>Our Old Schools</h1>
        <h2>Sander Sletvold, 385508</h2>
        <p>I went to high school at Skedsmo Videregående Skole.
            <br>
            Opposed to it's name, the school is acually located in Lillestrøm.
            <br>
            A few weeks before I started my first year, parts of the school were destroyed in a fire.
            <br>
            I would say the school could use some renovation, but me and many of the approximately 1200 students can look back at great years. 
        </p>    
        <h2>Johannes Sæther, josae4857</h2>
        <p>I went to high school at Glemmen Videregående Skole.
            <br>
            The school holds around 1,500 students
            <br>
            The school has several small buildings spread across the city
            <br>
            The school is also one of Fredrikstad's largest
        </p>
        <h2>Johannes Solheim, josol4436</h2>
        <p>I went to Stabekk Videregående skole. <br>
            At Stabekk there is around 600 students and is located in Bærum. <br>
            I had a specialization in math and computer sience. <br>
            I had some of the best years of my life at Stabekk and it was at stabekk that I figured out that i wanted to study computer sience. <br>
